# Introduction

A model is a mathematical description of a physical, chemical, or biological state or process whose part are mathematical concepts such as constant, variables, function, equation, inequalities, etc. Using a model help us to think about such processes and their mechanisms, so we can design better experiments and comprehend the results. 
Models are tools that assist in theory development \cite{cavagnaro2013mathematical}. Criteria for selecting a model include the goodness of fit, freedom from systematic error and simplicity. To fit the model we need regression. The regression model is an equation that defines the outcome, or dependent variable Y, as
a function of an independent variable X, and one or more model parameters. The regression model determines a relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable by providing a function. Regression analysis is often used to demonstrate association among variables believed to be biologically related. Linear and non-linear regression fit a mathematical model to the data to determine the best values of the parameters of the model.
